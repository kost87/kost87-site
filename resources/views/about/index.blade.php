                Hi, my name is Konstantin Konev. I am a programmer and software developer. I was born in 1987 in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
                I graduated from college in 2007, where I spent 3 years studying computer science and programming. Then, I started to work as an IT engineer. 
                In 2008, I was admitted to the university. I worked and studied at the university through a distance education course. I graduated in 2014, 
                specializing in software development.

                My professional sphere is web development. I worked for a training center where I developed two web applications for education. 
                In 2022, I changed my job. Currently, I am participating in the development of a large web application for a building design company.
                The technology stack I use includes PHP and JavaScript (with JQuery). Additionally, I have learned C/C++, Visual Basic, C#, and Python programming languages.
                I have experience in using Linux, Git, and Docker.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                I like to learn new IT technologis, especially in programming. Aside from programming, my interests include movies, computer games, bike riding and traveling.
